-- [Monitoring other processes]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- 
-- Lookout monitors other (citizen) processes.
-- If disconnected (every other node went down), do something ?...
--
-- How to differentiate between single node and disconnected node ? (No need to, actually)
-- Having msgs to propagate - while disconnected, do we hold them ?
--
-- Propagating after disconnection vs requesting information after disconnection.
-- Choose latter ?
--
-- While disconnected (no other nodes) -> lookout looks for other nodes,
-- citizen sleeps ?
--
-- citizen Disconnect to connected -> request messages between last msg to current time
-- 
-- Two lookout loops - one for single-node state, other for multiple-nodes state.
-- Single node state - look for other nodes, handle Hi's, do not propagate any messages
-- Multi-node state  - handle Hi's from other nodes, propagate msgs
--
-- Citizen loops:
-- Single node state - disconnected, process msgs (most likely from rng or some lost in the buffer)
-- Switch from disconnected to connected -> request changes (how many, from each node?), after that resume loop
-- Multi-node  state - connected, process msgs
-- Switch from connected to disconnected -> do nothing, just go
--
-- Requesting changes is the most problematic here. Lookout knows other nodes, citizen does not. 
-- Citizen propagates msg to lookout, and citizen waits for responses - how many will he receive ? 
-- He should receive all.
-- Should he wait for all ?
-- New msgs should be storred in a different state
-- Request in intervals (message spam?), until the spots are filled.
--
-- Hashes can be used to 
--
-- Citizen spawns another process which collects msgs up till certain time ?
--
-- Collisions between messages... ok, that will be dealt later on. For now one honest generator
